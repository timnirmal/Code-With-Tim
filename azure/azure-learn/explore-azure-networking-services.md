Suppose your company, Tailwind Traders, has migrated some applications to the cloud and is architecting new ones. The servers that host Tailwind Traders' customer and product data are based in Silicon Valley. Your company also has several branch offices located in different geographic regions. As part of your migration strategy, your company needs to determine the correct approach to configure its network infrastructure.

To help save costs, you convince your team to move your website and several of your other networked resources to the cloud. With that in mind, you'll need to provide secure access to private company data for each of its branch locations. You want to know how Azure can help you manage your network more effectively. As it turns out, managing networks on Azure isn't entirely different from managing on-premises networks.

In this module, you'll learn about the different Azure networking options and the scenarios in which each is appropriate.
